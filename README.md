## <ins>Next Steps
1. Add a progress page to each exercise so the user can look back at how far they've come
2. Use an API to help populate a user's routines with less typing
3. Copy another user's routine or exercises onto your own page.
4. Add comments to other users pages, and like each others comments.
5. Have a follow/news feed where people share their progress or goals
6. Bring the 8bit theme to life with an interractive progress page, where goals are set and mapped as if it were a classic Mario game on NES
7. Show "today's routine" after login (by way of a frequency property)
8. Send notifications if a workout was missed (regularly track when workouts are done)
